# kiesjerijksdocent
For my gradiuation-stunt, a tradition in the Netherlands, me and 2 friends wanted to elect a teacher as new sheriff (the theme of the stunt was wild west) for the school. 

They made the posters, and I made the site. It needed to be fixed on the day itself a few times, but in the end it held up working with almost a thousand votes

The fixes on the day itself had to do with saving to the json file. It does not look like nice code now, due to the fact I did not know exactly how the problem was caused, and therefore did not have time or knowledge to make a "good" solution.

The site kan be found (for the rest of the year) at kiesjerijksdocent.nl
